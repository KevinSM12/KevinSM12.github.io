        <h1>Uses for Minecraft in an Education Setting</h1>

        <p>
            Minecraft is an open world sandbox exploration game where you can do basically whatever you want. <br>
            Thanks to this freedom many people have used the game as a medium to demonstrate real world <br>
            scientific phenomena such as gravity and sedimentary rock. Due to these efforts by many inteligent people<br>
            Mojang the creator of minecraft developed an official Education Edition of Minecraft for use in schools <br>
            to help lessons feel more engaging. They added all new features like a periodic table of elements.

            Some of these features are here to help teachers have a greater control over the lesson, such as <br>
            Classroom Mode. This is a separate copatiable app that allows the teacher to see a top down view of the world<br>
            and a list of all the players. Also they can give the students items or teleport them to help them stay on track.<br>
            Most of the other features are here to educate the students on a wide range of topics. From chemistry to physics <br>
